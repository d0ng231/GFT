Large values of this feature can be indicative of vessels originating from neovascularization, which occurs in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Other reasons for large volumes may be the elimination of bifurcations due to capillary dropout, resulting in long and therefore voluminous vessel segments. This is an indicator of diabetic retinopathy. \n"
        
                "length – (Vessel segment centerline length) The length feature describes the length of the centerline of a vessel segment. Large values indicate a long centerline, and small values indicate a short centerline. A local accumulation of vessel segments with small length values that are interconnected indicate high network complexity. High network complexity is an indicator of healthiness. Conversely, a local accumulation of vessel segments with high length values may indicate capillary dropout and areas of low vessel network complexity.

Low values indicate that the vessel is not curved, which is a typical characteristic of healthiness. Loop-like structures result in very high curveness values. Loops and therefore large curveness values are associated with neovascularization, which is present in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n"

Vessel segments can either end with a bifurcation into two or more other vessels, or they are terminal vessels. Large terminal vessels are a sign of capillary dropout. In healthy individuals, a large number of small terminal capillaries are expected. \n"

Vessel segments may either end with a bifurcation into two or more other vessels, or they may be terminal vessels. If both ends of the vessel segments are terminal, this is most likely associated with under-segmentation due to abnormal changes in the vasculature (e.g. stenosis). \n"

The degree is related to the complexity of the vascular network. High complexity is associated with a healthy vasculature, therefore areas with many vessel segments of high degree, are healthy areas. Areas with few vessel segments of low degree are areas of low complexity associated with disease. \n"

                "avgRadiusStd - (Standard deviation of the average radius along a vessel segment centerline) The avgRadiusStd feature describes the standard deviation of the average radius along all the points on the centerline. A large standard deviation indicates irregularities in the thickness of the vessel segment. This may indicate stenosis or unnatural bulging within the vessel segment. High values are therefore indicative of abnormalities and therefore often of disease. Low values indicate a regular shape of the vessel and are therefore associated with healthiness. \n"

High values indicate that the vessel segment has an irregular outline. Low values indicate a normal structured vessel segment.\n"
